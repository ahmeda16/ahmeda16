# Welcome!

My name is Syed Ahmed but you can call me Abraham. I am a Computer Engineering Student at the University of Manitoba.

Generally, this GitHub will only be for school related stuff but may also have personal projects. 
Currently, I am in the learning phase in Command and Data Handling for our Satellite and Technology Society. Currently trying to speed learn C, FreeRTOS, Linux and Git, CSS, and other languages.

My current website is https://ahmeda16.github.io. It is not finished and will be later on.

If you need to contact me then you should via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/syed-abraham-ahmed/. If youre an associate, you already should have my information.
